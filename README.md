# i3dots
My Manjaro i3 setup. Oberon's Manjaro i3 community edition is used as a base.

## Goals:
+ Simple and functional.
+ Easy on the eyes.
+ No extensive ricing.
+ A distraction free environment for my works.

## Requirements:
+ zsh + ohmyzsh

## To-Do:
- [ ] Create a bash script for automatically setting up the environment.

Looks something like this (changes a lot):
